# We Are Worldkind!

## What is Worldkind?

There are many organisations out there which are helping to clean the oceans with the help of donations, but many people don't know how or where to contribute.

As a solution to this, we're building a platform that introduces people to amazing organisations working hard to clean up the oceans!


<!-- 
---------------------------------
What is the goal of this project?
---------------------------------

Need to talk to Team about our KPIs, might be nice to add this to the Readme

-----------------
How does it work?
-----------------

We've built a website using the Gatsby Framework with React.

It's hosted on Netlify.

Styled Components has been used to create consistent, reactive styles across the website.

------------------
Who are the users?
------------------

Anyone can use Worldkind!

----------------------------------
What is the benefit for the users?
----------------------------------

Not-For Profits and Charities are vetted and connected to through our websites to potential donors.

Donors can find interesting and trustworthy organisations that they can give their money to with confidence.
